										<p>
                                            The most ubiquitous representation of 2D surfaces in 3D space is the polygon mesh.  In this assignment, you will explore the <i>half-edge dsta structure</i>, which is the gold standard for traversing oriented manifold meshes.  You will begin with some basic traversal tasks, which will then unlock some more advanced topological and geometric operations.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Scoring</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This assignment is out of <b>100 points</b>.  80 of these points are <b>required tasks</b> that everyone has to do.  Beyond that, there are a number of extra points up for grabs which you can choose from to pursue your interests and "make the assignment your own."  Any points that you get beyond 20 will apply to extra credit at a rate of 1 point, 4/5 points, 4/5^2 points, 4/5^3 points, etc.  The required points and the optional points will be graded independently.  So, for instance, if you get an 75/80 on the required points and you earn 30 optional points, then your final score will be <b>75 + 20 + 4.6 = 99.4/100</b> points, which is quite a formidable score!
                                        </p>

You can set the factor by which to inflate with the <code>inflateFac</code> slider.  A positive number inflates, and a negative number deflates.  Depending on the dimensions of your mesh, you may have to adjust the dynamic range of this a lot (e.g. a mesh whose bounding box is [0, 1000] x [0, 1000] x [0, 1000] is much less affected by moving along the normal by a factor of 0.1 than a mesh whose bounding box is [0, 1] x [0, 1] x [0, 1])

                                            Move each vertex of the mesh by the average of the vectors from the vertex to its neighbors.  This is depicted by the green vector in the image below, which is the mean of the black vectors pointing from the vertex (red dot) to its neighbors (grey dots).  When adding this vector to the vertex, it is smoothed, as it will move protrusions down towards a plane fit through its neighbors (the tip of the green arrow).  When subtracting this vector, it moves away from this plane, and the mesh is sharpened.
